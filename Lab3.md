## Lab3 - Evolving both stars - Modeling The Mass Gainer


In Lab1 we assumed fully conservative mass transfer, i.e. ($\beta$ == 1). In Lab2 we included the effects of nonconservative mass transfer. Now, here in Lab3, we will explore the impact of evolving both stars self consistently.


In this lab, we would like to explore how the evolution of the primary - more massive - star  and the secondary - less massive - star differ from those run with the "star + point_mass" framework where we approximate the secondary as a point masss to save some computation time.
