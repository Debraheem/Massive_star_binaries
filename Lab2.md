# Lab2 - Exploring the Stability of Mass Transfer

This lab will continue using the downloaded `Lab1_binary` directory from Lab1 where we are modeling our system as a star + point mass. In `inlist_project` and make sure you are running in single star mode: `evolve_both_stars = .false.`.

### Science goal

The goal of this lab is to explore how binaries evolve depending on the companion mass and mass ratios $q\equiv M_2/M_1$. The aim is to see the diversity of stellar evolution when the star is in a binary. This lab will focus on identifying when mass transfer is stable or unstable in low and high mass ratio binary systems. This lab closely follows the [2022 MESA Summer School Maxilab provided by Pablo Marchant](https://orlox.github.io/mesa2022_hmxb/).

### Bonus goal

Our bonus goal is to explore the impact of adopting a nonconservative mass transfer prescription on mass transfer stability.


## When is mass transfer stable versus unstable?

Mass transfer in binary systems is often classified as stable or unstable. There is no universal definition for the stability, but it is often understood as follows.

Stable Mass transfer: When mass transfer proceeds in a controlled manner, without leading to dramatic changes in the system. The donor star loses mass at a rate that allows the binary system to remain bound and evolve over time. Typically, this results in a smooth and gradual transfer of mass.

Unstable Mass Transfer: This occurs when the mass transfer process leads to rapid and uncontrollable changes in the system. The donor star loses mass at a rate that destabilizes the system, typically considered to lead to a common envelope phase, where the envelope of the donor star engulfs both stars, or even to the merger of the two stars. This usually results in dramatic, often short-lived, evolutionary changes in the binary system. 

Mass transfer rates can reach values as high as a solar mass per year. "Due to the limitations within MESA, as a code which models the donor star as a 1-dimensional object. For extreme mass ratios, the shrinkage of the orbit as mass transfer proceeds becomes extreme enough that the star cannot adjust itself through mass loss to avoid extreme overflow. In such a case the donor would very likely engulf its companion, initiating a process of common-envelope evolution which is fundamentally 3-dimensional. MESA being a 1-dimensional code cannot deal with such a situation, but rather tries to keep modeling this evolutionary phase as a stable mass transfer event with an ever increasing mass transfer rate, which eventually leads to numerical problems." ~ Pablo Marchant

Rather than attempting to approximate a common-envelope phase with MESA, we will simply construct a physical criteria to identify when an unstable mass transfer phase could start, and terminate the evolution at that stage. For this purpose we will consider the thermal and dynamical timescales of the the donor star.

Although there are ways to approximate a common-envelope phase with MESA, here we wish to simply construct a physical criterion to identify when an unstable mass transfer phase could start, and terminate the evolution at that stage. For this purpose, we will consider the thermal and dynamical timescales of the star:

$$\tau_{\text{thermal}} = \frac{GM^2}{RL}, \quad \tau_{\text{dynamical}} = \frac{1}{G \langle \rho \rangle} $$

From these, one can define characteristic mass transfer rates:

$$
\dot{M}_{\text{thermal}} = \frac{M}{\tau_{\text{thermal}}}
$$

$$ \quad \dot{M}_{\text{dynamical}} = \frac{M}{\tau_{\text{dynamical}}}
$$

As a criterion to test for unstable mass transfer, we will check at the end of each timestep if the mass transfer rate $\(\dot{M}_{\text{transfer}}\)$ exceeds significantly the thermal rate. This is indicative of the donor approaching a near-adiabatic behavior, leading to runaway overflow. In particular, we will require that 

$$
\dot{M}_{\text{transfer}} > 100 \dot{M}_{\text{thermal}}
$$

to terminate our simulation.

We will need additional information at the end of a run, as well as an additional termination condition. While exploring a grid with multiple physical variations, one thing that can happen is that the binary is too wide to undergo Roche-lobe overflow. So we want our run to report the maximum amount of Roche lobe overflow $(R/R_{\text{Rl}})$ when it terminates. 

|:clipboard: TASK 2|
|:--|
|In `extras_binary_finish_step` store the value of $\(R/R_{\text{Rl}}\)$ in `b% xtra(2)` if it exceeds the value of `b% xtra(2)`. By default, `b% xtra(2)` is initiated at zero, so in this way, you will keep its maximum value.|
|In `extras_binary_after_evolve` include a `write(*,*) "Check maximum R/R_Rl", b% xtra(2)` line to output the maximum value achieved. The `extras_binary_after_evolve` subroutine is called once the simulation finishes.|

The other thing we will need to add is a check on overflow. The Kolb scheme allows stars to overflow, with larger mass transfer rates happening at larger overflow. But if the radius of the star exceeds the orbital separation, there's definitely something fishy happening! 

|:clipboard: TASK 3|
|:--|
|Add another termination condition that checks if the radius of the star exceeds the binary separation (use `b%r(1)` and `b% separation`).|

|Remember this can be added in `extras_binary_finish_step`. Be sure to add a `write(*,*)` statement saying why the run finished!|

<details markdown="block">

In `extras_binary_finish_step`, add :
```fortran   
       if (b% r(1) > b% separation) then
           write(*,*) "Finish simulation due to radius exceeding separation"

After making these changes we want to run our model to see if it triggers the condition. Also, we want to see how the thermal timescale compares to the dynamical one.

Having physical termination conditions to capture regions where MESA cannot properly model an evolutionary phase can be very valuable. It helps avoid the production of spurious results, and also avoids simulations from getting stuck into situations where timesteps become extremely small and simulations could in principle run for years without completing. This can be a big issue when running a large number of simulations in a cluster, potentially leading to a significant waste of resources. 

Before running the model, adopt the following `&binary_controls` in `inlist_progject`:

```
   m1 = 15d0  ! donor mass in Msun
   m2 = 6d0 ! companion mass in Msun
   initial_period_in_days = 2d0
```

Now, we will run the model to test our termination condition. As before, for this, we need to execute the below commands in the terminal

```shell-session
$ ./clean
$ ./mk
$ ./rn
```

Your model should terminate roughly around model number 110 and return the following stopping condition

```shell-session

### Approximating the final state of the Binary

So if mass transfer can proceed stably for extreme mass ratios, we could potentially get an extreme reduction in orbital separation! This is particularly interesting in the context of gravitational wave sources (van den Heuvel et al. (2017)), where the time for two point masses to merge depends strongly on the orbital separation. For a circular orbit, the merger time is (Peters, P. C. (1964)):

$$
t_{\text{merger}} = \frac{a^4}{4B}, \quad B \equiv \frac{64G^3}{5c^5} \frac{(M_1 + M_2)}{M_1 M_2}
$$

Taking arbitrarily high initial mass ratios could, in principle, lead to arbitrarily small post mass-transfer separations, but there is a competition with mass transfer stability, which we have studied in the previous lab. The purpose of this lab is to study whether or not at the boundary for stability the mass ratio is extreme enough to provide the required shrinkage in orbital separation for gravitational waves to take over. We will consider a \(30M_{\odot}\) donor star with different masses for a black hole companion and compute a grid of simulations using all the cores at disposition from the attending crowd. Throughout the lab, we will make use of `mdot_scheme='Kolb'`.


Now, rather than modeling the system all the way to helium depletion, we will make some big assumptions for its final state of the system. This will allow us to only model a fraction of its evolution, which is useful to explore a large input parameter space.

We will assume that after the donor stripped down to its helium core mass t\(20M_{\odot}\), mass transfer will proceed successfully until the star is stripped down to its helium core.

The final separation after mass transfer will be computed using Equation (1).

We will assume that after stripping, mass loss is negligible, and the star will form a black hole with no mass loss at all (direct collapse while ignoring any neutrino losses). This means we also take the separation after mass transfer to be the separation when the binary black hole forms. Using that information, we will compute the merger time with Equation (2).

To include a termination condition based on reaching a minimum mass limit, you can use `star_mass_min_limit = 20d0` in the controls section of `inlist1`.

The information on the helium core mass is stored in the `star_info` variable `he_core_mass`. In `run_binary_extras` you can access it with `b%s1%he_core_mass`. Beware that this is not in grams but in \(M_{\odot}\) units! Now, we are not interested in you spending too much time just typing equations, so we provide you here the solution right away. The following is the final version of `extras_binary_after_evolve`, be sure to check it and understand what it is doing (it includes the reporting of maximum overflow implemented previously).

## Exploring a grid of mass transfer models with varying mass ratios
To explore the stability of mass transfer across various mass ratios and orbital periods. Let's start by assuming fully conservative mass transfer, i.e. ($\beta=0$).

For this lab we will keep the Primary/donor mass fixed at **`m1 = 15d0`**, do not adjust this mass. We will explore the binary evolution of our system with varying periods and mass ratios `m2/m1` by modifying `initial_period_in_days` and `m2`. We will explore the following mass range $M_{2} = 1.5 - 12 M_{\odot}$ and periods $P_\mathrm{orb} = 2 - 512$ days. We've descritized this parameter space in the following two tables:

| Companion (accretor) Mass ( $M_{\odot}$ ) |
